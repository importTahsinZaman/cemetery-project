Under the Higgons household, there is a person named Esther Look, who is assumed to be a servant of the house because she has no known occupation, meaning that she would not be able to pay rent (if she were a boarder), and she is also not a member of the family. Based on the assumption that Esther was a servant, it can be inferred that Jesse Higgons and John Axford made enough money through their combined income to live a relatively nice lifestyle.

    analysis:
      "This excerpt is from volume 33 of The Westminster, published in the week of October 10, 1903. The section under the header “Philadelphia” provides news about numerous churches. In the highlighted portion of the document, it says that Reverend John Axford Higgons supplied (lead worship) to the Chambers Wylie Church in Chelsea, Massachusetts. However, it also states that Higgons lost both his church and home to “the awful conflagration in Chelsea last April.” <br/><br/>From this document, it was inferred that Higgons lost both his church and home to a fire in Chelsea, Massachusetts. However, despite the catastrophic fire that burned down his house, he still continued to preach. Through this, it can be inferred that Higgons was devoted to his job as a minister, and still preached around the city of Chelsea even though he no longer had a permanent residence.",

    analysis:
      "This book, titled The Burning of Chelsea, describes a catastrophic fire that occurred in Chelsea, Massachusetts in 1908. According to the book, the fire burned 492 acres and destroyed practically all the businesses in the center of the city, as well as municipal buildings and other buildings, leaving many people homeless. John Axford Higgons lived in Chelsea at the time of the fire.<br/><br/>It was inferred from this document that Higgons was one of the 17,450 people left homeless after the fire, as his address listed in the city directory at the time was located very close to the center of the city. In addition, it was stated that Higgons’ church was also burnt down by the fire, as it was also in close proximity to the center of Chelsea. In the book, it states that several churches in the city opened their doors to the recently displaced people, so it is assumed that John Axford Higgons took up residence in one of the churches while he continued his work in Chelsea.",
