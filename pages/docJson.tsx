      "This document is an excerpt from the book “A History of the City Newark, New Jersey,” Volume 2. The book gives an overview of the history of Newark and includes a section regarding the Central Presbyterian Church on Clinton and Belmont Avenues. The document gives a list of pastors that have been at the church since its inception, including John Axford Higgons. John Axford Higgons was there from May 17, 1898, to December 7, 1903.<br/><br/>From this document, it can be inferred that the church had one pastor between May 17th, 1989, and February 6th, 1902, as no other pastor was there. It can be inferred that during this time period, a substantial amount of Higgons’s work at the church, Higgons had an important role in the church community. This document also has Higgons’s occupation in Newark, agreeing with the 1900 census that has him residing there. It confirms that Higgons resided in Newark from 1898 to 1903, and also lines up with the fact that he was an evangelist from 1902 to 1904, considering another pastor began preaching starting February 6, 1902.",

The immediate cause of her death was “coronary occlusion”, or the partial or complete blockage of a coronary artery.

Coronary occlusion restricts blood flow to the heart, which can lead to a heart attack. In addition, it is possible that the other condition listed as “A.S.” is atherosclerosis or aortic stenosis, both of which restrict blood flow, and can lead to a heart attack. Furthermore, Ella Higgons passed away relatively quickly, within an hour, because it was certified that she was attended to from 10:30 to her time of death at 11:30. These symptoms indicate that she had cardiovascular complications, and these may have led to her untimely death.",

In 1910, Higgons became pastor at the Ninth Presbyterian Church in Philadelphia, and he continued to work around the area until 1925 when he retired to Bala Cynwyd.<br/><br/>There is a separation between the years 1891 to 1894: “91-92, 93-95,” so it can be inferred that there was some event that caused Higgons to briefly leave the Union Theological Seminary. There is no confirmation that Higgons attended the Union Theological Seminary from 1892 to 1893, so it can be inferred that Higgons took a gap year, which could coincide with his marriage and the birth of his first child in 1892.",
