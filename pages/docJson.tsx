Under the Higgons household, there is a person named Esther Look, who is assumed to be a servant of the house because she has no known occupation, meaning that she would not be able to pay rent (if she were a boarder), and she is also not a member of the family. Based on the assumption that Esther was a servant, it can be inferred that Jesse Higgons and John Axford made enough money through their combined income to live a relatively nice lifestyle.

In the highlighted portion of the document, it says that Reverend John Axford Higgons supplied (lead worship) to the Chambers Wylie Church in Chelsea, Massachusetts. However, it also states that Higgons lost both his church and home to “the awful conflagration in Chelsea last April.” <br/><br/>From this document, it was inferred that Higgons lost both his church and home to a fire in Chelsea, Massachusetts. However, despite the catastrophic fire that burned down his house, he still continued to preach. Through this, it can be inferred that Higgons was devoted to his job as a minister, and still preached around the city of Chelsea even though he no longer had a permanent residence.",

John Axford Higgons lived in Chelsea at the time of the fire.<br/><br/>It was inferred from this document that Higgons was one of the 17,450 people left homeless after the fire, as his address listed in the city directory at the time was located very close to the center of the city. In addition, it was stated that Higgons’ church was also burnt down by the fire, as it was also in close proximity to the center of Chelsea. In the book, it states that several churches in the city opened their doors to the recently displaced people, so it is assumed that John Axford Higgons took up residence in one of the churches while he continued his work in Chelsea.",

      "This is the certificate of death of Ella Willard Higgons. Ella Higgons passed away on November 5, 1941, at 11:30 in the morning at the age of 76. She died 10 years before her husband. The immediate cause of her death was “coronary occlusion”, or the partial or complete blockage of a coronary artery. It is also noted that she had another condition at the time of death, “A.S.” Ella Willard Higgons passed away in her own house, 7 Montgomery Avenue, and her husband, John Axford Higgons, was the informant listed in the certificate.<br/><br/>From this document, it can be inferred that Ella Willard Higgons passed away due to cardiac arrest. Coronary occlusion restricts blood flow to the heart, which can lead to a heart attack. In addition, it is possible that the other condition listed as “A.S.” is atherosclerosis or aortic stenosis, both of which restrict blood flow, and can lead to a heart attack. Furthermore, Ella Higgons passed away relatively quickly, within an hour, because it was certified that she was attended to from 10:30 to her time of death at 11:30. These symptoms indicate that she had cardiovascular complications, and these may have led to her untimely death.",

      "This document is a World War Two Draft Registration Card for John Axford Higgons Junior. John Axford Higgons Jr. was 43 at the time of registration, and lived at 4 Beach Avenue, Larchmont, Westchester, New York, and he was married to Elizabeth L. Higgons when he registered for the World War II draft. It is also written that he is self-employed, and the location of his company is 66 Beaver Street, New York, New York. <br/><br/>John Axford Higgons Jr. was 43 years old at the time of registration, so it can be inferred that despite his relatively old age, he was in good health and was willing to serve in the war. Higgons Jr. was most likely patriotic, because he voluntarily filled out the registration card, as only people from ages 21 to 35 were required to register with their local draft board. Based on Higgons Jr.’s age at the time, it can be inferred that this card was filled out around 1941.",

At the time of registration, he was 21 years old and was living at 4 Beach Avenue, Larchmont, Westchester, New York, with his parents. He was a student at Princeton University at the time. <br/><br/>It can be inferred that the registration card was filled out in 1941, around the same time John Axford Higgons Jr. filled out his card because the father and son lived in the same house. Also, it is inferred that John Axford Higgons Jr. was required to fill out this form because he was a student at this time, and most likely would have continued his studies if not for the draft registration. In addition, by October 1940, all men between the ages of 21 and 35 were required to register to be drafted, which corroborates the inference.",

      "This document is a page from the book Alumni of Union Theological Seminary. It provides a brief history of Higgons, starting from when he was born and going up until he retired in 1925. The blurb states that he earned a diploma from the Union Theological Seminary in 1895, and was ordained on July 16, 1897. He became a pastor in Ocean City from 1897 to 1898, and then moved to Newark and worked as a pastor until 1900. From 1902 to 1904, Higgons was not a pastor, but an evangelist. Afterward, he continued working as a pastor in Massachusetts up until 1909. In 1910, Higgons became pastor at the Ninth Presbyterian Church in Philadelphia, and he continued to work around the area until 1925 when he retired to Bala Cynwyd.<br/><br/>There is a separation between the years 1891 to 1894: “91-92, 93-95,” so it can be inferred that there was some event that caused Higgons to briefly leave the Union Theological Seminary. There is no confirmation that Higgons attended the Union Theological Seminary from 1892 to 1893, so it can be inferred that Higgons took a gap year, which could coincide with his marriage and the birth of his first child in 1892.",

      "This document is the death certificate for John Axford Higgons. Higgons died on September 1st, 1951, at the age of 88. His leading cause of death was “Cancer of the Bowel”, more commonly known as colon cancer. He died in the comfort of his own home, as shown by his institution of death being “residence”, and no autopsy was conducted. He was a widow (his wife died about 10 years earlier) and the informant was his living daughter: Gladys Higgons. <br/><br/>From this document, we can infer that the symptoms of his cancer began around March 1951 because the doctor says that he attended to the deceased from March 23rd till his death. Higgons had lived a life of hard work, but he likely recently retired as the 1940 census has him employed as a clergyman, but his death certificate has him retired.",
